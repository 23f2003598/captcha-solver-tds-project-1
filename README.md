# Captcha Solver Demo This project provides a simple, single-file responsive HTML application designed to demonstrate a basic client-side interface for a Captcha solver. It utilizes Tailwind CSS for styling and includes a minimal JavaScript implementation to handle image display and a placeholder verification logic. **Please Note:** A true Captcha solver, especially for image-based captchas, requires complex Optical Character Recognition (OCR) or a robust backend service for verification. This demo primarily focuses on the front-end user experience and illustrates how a client-side application would interact with a Captcha. The "solving" logic provided is a simplified client-side check for a specific sample image and does not perform actual OCR. ## Features *   **Responsive Design:** Built with Tailwind CSS, ensuring a good user experience across various device sizes. *   **Dynamic Image Loading:** Can load a captcha image from a URL query parameter (`?url=https://.../image.png`) or defaults to a local `sample.png` file. *   **User Input Interface:** Provides an input field for users to type the captcha text. *   **Basic Verification Logic:** Includes a simple client-side check for the default `sample.png` captcha. ## Setup and Usage 1.  **Clone the Repository (or save the files):** Save `index.html`, `README.md`, `LICENSE`, and `sample.png` into the same directory. 2.  **Open `index.html`:** Simply open the `index.html` file in your web browser. 3.  **Default Captcha:** By default, the application will display the `sample.png` image. To verify this captcha, type `ADUR3` into the input field and click "Verify Captcha". 4.  **Custom Captcha URL:** You can provide your own captcha image URL by appending it as a query parameter. For example: `index.html?url=https://example.com/your-captcha-image.png` When a custom URL is used, the client-side "solver" will indicate that it cannot verify the captcha, as actual solving requires server-side logic or advanced OCR. ## Project Structure *   `index.html`: The main HTML file containing the application's structure, styling (via Tailwind CDN), and JavaScript logic. *   `sample.png`: The default captcha image used when no custom URL is provided. *   `README.md`: This file, providing information about the project. *   `LICENSE`: The MIT License for this project. ## Technologies Used *   HTML5 *   CSS (via Tailwind CSS CDN) *   JavaScript ## Contributing As this is a simple demonstration, direct contributions in the form of actual OCR are beyond the scope of this particular client-side demo. However, feel free to fork, adapt, and expand upon this project for your own purposes. ## License This project is open-source and available under the MIT License.
